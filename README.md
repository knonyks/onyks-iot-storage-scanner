> QR and barcode scanner for tracking and organizing tools and devices.

> "I’ve got two updates about my PCB project—one’s good, the other’s bad. The good news: I’ve finished it. The bad news: I’ve finished it… and it’s currently the world’s most advanced paperweight. Apparently, ‘super high tolerance’ doesn’t mean ‘works perfectly’—who knew? Well, at least it’s got all the pins in the right places... they just don’t do anything useful."
